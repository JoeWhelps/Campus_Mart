<b>Campus Mart Project</b>:

This project is to create a student marketplace where sellers can post listings and connect with buyers. There is also a messaging feature, and in-app purchase feature where users can have a limited number of listings a day before they must buy more.

You can either download the .zip file with embedded data with other users and listings on it, or run it locally as a clean slate.

Run the app:<br/>
The project is in a .zip file and once expanded you go to the main level and run:<br/>
<b>python3 manage.py runserver</b><br/>
