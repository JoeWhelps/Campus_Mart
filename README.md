<b>Brainstorm/Planning Notes</b> (will delete before presentation):

Plan for the App: 
Feature 1: Create a Profile, Login, Logout
Feature 2: Create, Update, Delete Listings
Feature 3: Browse and Search Listings
Feature 4: Limit/Buy more listings (KratosCoin)

First functionality, then HTML
<b>Feature 1:</b>
Almost done with Login, just need to add a "create account" button.

<b>Feature 2:</b>
Need to reconfigure polls into the blog post example- will paste in starter code.
